Description:
        The lab framework provides a set of interactive files that
        can be to this app. These files
        can be downloaded from a Lab framework release or from an
        archive that is remotely available at a URL.

        This will create a *large* set of files in the this project.

Example:
        This will download a tar file that contains the lab framework
        files and install locally. Notice that it's name contains the lab framework
        commit hash when the tar file was built.
        $ rails generate lab:download_lab http://lab.dev.concord.org/version/2666763.tar.gz

        This will *ONLY* install a tar file's content, located in
        tmp/lab.tar.gz into tmp/lab_files.
        $ rails generate lab:update_lab --no-download
