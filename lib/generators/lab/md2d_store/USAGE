Description:
    This will generate a module, Md2dStore, that is
    included into the Interactive Rails model. This module will use
    ActiveRecord::Store,
    http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Store.html, to
    provide a wrapper around the serialized attributes/properties that
    define an interactive.

    This generator will parse md2d metadata provided by the Next
    Gen MW, lab, framework and generate the correct set of serialized
    attributes for the Interactive Rails model.


Example:
    rails generate md2d_store

    This will create:
        app/models/concerns/md2d_store
