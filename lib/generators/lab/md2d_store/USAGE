Description:
    This will generate a module, Md2dStore, that should be
    included into the Interactive Rails model. This module will use
    ActiveRecord::Store,
    http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Store.html, to
    provide a wrapper around the serialized attributes/propeties that
    define an interactive.

    The module will parse md2d metadata provided by the Next
    Gen MW, lab, framework and generate the correct set of serialized
    attributes for the Interactive Rails model.


Example:
    rails generate md2d_store

    This will create:
        app/models/concerns/md2d_store
