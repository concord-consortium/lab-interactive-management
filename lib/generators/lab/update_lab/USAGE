Description:
        The lab framework provides a set of interactive files that
        **MUST** be imported into the public directory. These files
        can be imported from a Lab framework release or from an
        archive that is remotely available at a URL.

        This will create a *large* set of files in the public
        directory.

Example:
        This will download a tar file that contains the lab framework
        files and install it's contents in the public
        directory. Notice that it's name contains the lab framework
        commit hash when the tar file was built.
        $ rails generate lab:update_lab https://lab-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/lab_ab633d2.tar.gz

        This will *ONLY* install a tar file's content, located in
        tmp/lab.tar.gz, in the public directory.
        $ rails generate lab:update_lab --no-download
