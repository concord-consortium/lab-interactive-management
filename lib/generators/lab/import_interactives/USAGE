Description:
    Load the database with Interactives. This will download all the
    JSON that defines interactives from a source URL. It first looks
    for a interactives.json file that defines all of the interactives
    and groups. It follows references, URLs, in this interactive.json
    file and will downloads and process json files that define each group,
    interactive and md2d model.

    Each of the json files will generate a DB record, and AR model instance,
    for groups, interactives and md2d.

Example:
    rails generate lab:import_interactives
